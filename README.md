# MRTK AR Transcription Project for Speech Recognition in Unreal 5.1.1

FOR HW3: 
- I implemented the speech recognizer into the HTC Vive headset level and it works. See attached screenshot in this folder for a laugh.
- I included files for the AR version for HoloLens 2 and separate files for the VIVE.
- The house of quality is attached in this github repo as well.

See folders: 	VIVE_Files
