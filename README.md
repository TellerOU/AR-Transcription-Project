# MRTK AR Transcription Project for Speech Recognition in Unreal 5.1.1

## FOR HW3: 
- I implemented the speech recognizer into the HTC Vive headset level and it works. See attached screenshot.

- I then added infinitely scrolling text that starts a new line every time it recognizes something for the homework problem 2 part b. Note that I did this as part of the VIVE project and upgraded to the Medium model size for Speech.
- I attached screenshots for an exmaple of this working in the VR view and also the blueprint if you didnt feel like cloning the entire project.

- I included files for the AR version for HoloLens 2 and separate files for the VIVE.

- The house of quality is attached in this github repo as well.
